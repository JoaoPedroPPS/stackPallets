 Management of Pallets using stack features, for learning purposes.
 
 ## What is this software?
 
 This is a very simple project made for learning the basics of Stacks usage in Java, for that, we imagined a software for management of a industrial pallet, used in commercial storages. 
 
 This software has a search function, allowing it to find the product the user wants to sell or store more units; then it moves all of the products above it to an auxilliary pallet, allowing the user to either remove his wanted product, or store more units of it. Then, all of the products on the auxilliary pallet are placed back on top.
